            During my studies at the Technical University of Moldova, I took a
            course in Cryptography that delved into essential encryption methods
            and security protocols. I gained a strong understanding of both
            classical and modern encryption techniques, including RSA, AES, and

            digital data and communications, which is crucial for a career in
            web development and cybersecurity.
